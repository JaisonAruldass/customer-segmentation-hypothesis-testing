ðŸŽ¯ Project Overview
This project demonstrates professional-grade customer analytics by applying advanced statistical methods to understand mall customer behavior patterns. Unlike typical customer analysis projects, this implementation emphasizes statistical rigor, proper validation, and business-actionable insights.
Key Differentiators

âœ… Proper Statistical Testing with assumption validation
âœ… Multiple Testing Correction (FDR method)
âœ… Effect Size Reporting for practical significance
âœ… Robust Clustering Validation with stability analysis
âœ… Cross-Validated Predictive Models
âœ… Business-Focused Feature Engineering

ðŸ“Š Dataset
The analysis uses mall customer data containing:

Demographics: Age, Gender
Financial: Annual Income (k$)
Behavioral: Spending Score (1-100)
Sample Size: 200 customers

ðŸ”¬ Methodology
Statistical Analysis Pipeline
1. Data Quality Assessment

Missing value detection
Outlier identification (IQR method)
Data type validation
Range verification

2. Feature Engineering with Business Logic
python# Created Features:
Life_Stage          # Young_Adult, Early_Career, Mid_Career, Mature
Income_Level        # Low, Medium, High (based on terciles)
Spending_Level      # Conservative, Moderate, High_Spender
Spending_Efficiency # Spending relative to income capacity
Age_Adjusted_Spending # Lifecycle-normalized spending patterns

4. Advanced Clustering Analysis

Algorithm: K-means with standardized features
Optimization: Elbow method + Silhouette analysis
Validation: 10-fold stability analysis through resampling
Quality Metrics: Silhouette scores, inertia tracking

5. Predictive Modeling

Classification: Random Forest â†’ Predict spending categories
Regression: Random Forest â†’ Predict exact spending scores
Validation: Stratified K-fold cross-validation
Feature Importance: Identify key behavioral drivers

ðŸ“ˆ Key Results
Statistical Findings

Multiple Testing Correction Applied: FDR (Benjamini-Hochberg) method
Effect Sizes Reported: Small, medium, large classifications
Assumption Validation: Normality and homogeneity tests performed

Customer Segmentation

Optimal Clusters: Determined via silhouette analysis
